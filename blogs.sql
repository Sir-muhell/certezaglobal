However, as Christians, you start your journey to destiny the day you discover purpose because, your destiny is your destination in Christ. Purpose in itself is one way or the other attached to the gospel. You may say \"my purpose is to change the statuesque in the music world or to change the narrative in politics\". Whatsoever your purpose is, it is so that God can be glorified because that is the ultimate reason we were created -</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">Isa</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">iah&nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">43:7.

The total plan of God is like a puzzle that has been split into smaller portions. Every piece is important and that makes you very important because you are a carrier of a piece. The complete plan of God can only be expressed when every piece is right in place. Amazingly, every piece of a puzzle is one way or the other connected to another piece therefore, it is important that every piece is in the right place and is given expression. You are still alive because God has an expression He wants to give to the world through your life. The question is, \" Are you yielding? Are you a missing piece?\"</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">As humans, we are often found in one of these three states:</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;\">You haven\'t discovered the plan and purpose of God for your life like Saul.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;You have discovered God\'s plan and purpose for your life but, you\'re running like Jonah.<br></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;\">You have discovered His plan and purpose for your life and you are walking in it like Jesus.</span></li></ol><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:\'Times New Roman\';\r\nfont-size:11.0000pt;\">If you are like Saul, you\'d be doing yourself the favour of repenting and going back to the father.

(3, 'SELF MANAGEMENT', 'MOTIVATION', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">Have you ever planned your day the night before or maybe very early the same day? Did you follow the plan? Have you been able to complete the task for a day? I bet I can give an answer to that. But, as for me, the answer used to be \'no\' until I stumbled on one of Peter Drucker\'s words. He said \"You cannot manage time; you can only manage yourself.\"</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">We live in a world of people with great ideas, plans, proposals, goals etc. But in actual sense, they don\'t execute all of these because there is never enough time. The fact is that you cannot save time; you can only spend it in a different way. There is no area in your life in which self-discipline is more important than in the way you spend your time. Time management is a basic discipline that largely establishes the quality of your life. In other words, time management is life management.</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">Life management is the conscious ability to choose the order of happenings in your life. It is accessing the true value in everything you do. It is the determination to always do the important things first before others - putting into perspective your priorities. You can tell how much value something has to you by the amount of time you invest in it. </span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">There are so many things you involve yourself in and you spend so much time on yet they are not as important as the things you say \'you\'ll do later\'. There are things that make little or no difference if you do not do them at all. There are things with little or no consequences if left undone. There are also things you can leave for other people to do. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">The major importance of time management is that it improves the quality of your life. Also, it makes you a more organized person. You are able to achieve more in less time and the most important things in your life are never left untouched. However, the most powerful word in our time management is \"no\".</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">You may probably be overwhelmed by a lot of tasks. You need to ask yourself questions like, \"What am I doing that isn\'t so important?\" What things can I stop doing in order to focus on more important things? Is this the best way to spend my time? Allocate your time to people and things who deserve it and not those who demand it. The law of efficiency says \"There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important things.\"</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">Brian Tracy said in one of his books, \"You require tremendous discipline to set priorities and then stick to those priorities. You require the continuous exertion of principle and willpower to overcome the procrastination that holds most people back. However, the more you discipline yourself to use your time well, the happier you will feel and the better will be the quality of your life in every area.\"</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\">Ten to twelve minutes of planning your day will save at least two hours of wasted time and effort throughout the day. Quit procrastination because, whatever you do repeatedly eventually becomes a habit. Plan your day ahead by arranging your task according to priority. Start with the most important and give it your 100% concentration.</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:\'yes\';font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0000pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>', '63894300_1597310427.jpg', 'publish', '2020-08-10', 'admin', '11', 12),

Most often than not, they are\r\nalways little details. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some years ago, I was in the final\r\nclass in secondary school. It was the usual long holiday and I was attending\r\nthe summer classes. One beautiful morning, I walked hurriedly along the road\r\npassing some shops. As I was approaching the bus stop, I saw a man standing in\r\nfront of a shop - He was standing with his arms akimbo staring at nothing.\r\n\"Good Morning Sir!\", I said as I passed before him. He didn\'t\r\nrespond. I greeted him again this time with a louder voice. \"Good Morning\r\nSir!\" There was still no response.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I began to complain to my brother\r\nwho was walking beside me. \"Where is the man?\", he asked. I turned\r\nback and pointed at the man. To my surprise, my brother started laughing. I\r\nbecame angry wondering what exactly was funny. \"What is funny?\" I\r\nasked with an angry voice. \"That is a mannequin\" he managed to say as\r\nhe laughed harder. I then stopped and looked sternly, paying attention to every\r\ndetail of his appearance. He had been standing on the same spot and staring\r\ninto God knows what. He had no hair on his head and his fingers did not look\r\nreal. His body looked like that of the doll I played with when I was younger.\r\nHe also had no shoes on. I was so pained. How did I make such a huge mistake?\r\nIt was an error on my part and not the mannequin\'s fault. \"How did I not\r\nsee all of these while approaching him?\" I thought to myself. This is a day\r\nI will never forget. I simply did not pay attention.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To pay attention is to give your\r\nmental focus to something. To observe keenly - to look properly. Attention is\r\npaid to discern and to differentiate. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Christians, it is very\r\nimportant for us to pay attention to everything that goes on within us and\r\naround us. Sometimes, the devil puts before us empty threats and situations that\r\nare not real in themselves, and other times, he appears as an angel of light\r\nhereby deceiving those who do not pay attention.&nbsp; He whispers lies into our ears and many times\r\nwe believe them simply because we\'ve not paid enough attention to God\'s word.\r\nWe forget the realities of God\'s word and opt for the lies of the devil.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are details in the written\r\nword of God and in the spoken word of God. It is therefore important for us to\r\npay attention in the place of prayer, study and even our daily living. The\r\ndevil is looking for whom to devour.&nbsp; It\r\nis possible to hear your voice or the voice of the devil and take it for the\r\nvoice of God. You\'d only be able to identify God\'s voice if you constantly pay\r\nattention. Pay attention! You can\'t be in haste and pay attention. We have the Spirit\r\nof truth available to us who will guide us, but to obey Him, you need to pay\r\nattention.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>', '38370600_1597594530.jpg', 'publish', '2020-08-16', 'olapearl', '10', 1),

Your ability to\r\npersist in the face of all setbacks and temporary failures is essential to\r\nsuccess in life.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Napoleon Hill said, \"Persistence is to the character of man\r\nas carbon is to steel.\"&nbsp; The primary reason for success is persistence, and,\r\nlikewise, the primary reason for failure is lack of persistence, quitting too\r\nsoon.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is a direct link between self-discipline and self-\r\nesteem. Each time you discipline yourself to do what you should do, when you\r\nshould do it, whether you feel like it or not, your self-esteem increases. This\r\nwhy there is direct relationship between self-esteem and persistence. Each time\r\nyou persist and force yourself to continue on, even when you feel like\r\nquitting, your self-esteem goes up.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Each act of self-discipline strengthens every other act of\r\nself- discipline.

I can relate with the fact that\r\nliving according to the perfect will of our father in this perverse world is not\r\neasy. I understand that sometimes, we find it easy to call home, study our\r\nmanual - the bible and live according to the principles of our kingdom.

Your best plans will fail if there is no dedication to consistency.</div><div><br></div><div>John Maxwell said: \"Small disciplines repeated with consistency everyday lead to great achievements gained slowly overtime.\" Take small and steady but consistent steps towards your goal and choose consistency over perfection, because in actual fact, perfection comes with consistency.</div>', '68495100_1598353845.jpeg', 'publish', '2020-08-25', 'admin', '11', 0),
